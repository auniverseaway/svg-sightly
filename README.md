# SVG - Sightly
An SVG Component for AEM 6.0+ built in Sightly.

# Install
Drop into your existing components directory. Make sure "AEM Components" are available in your sidekick.

# Usage
You can use Classic or Touch UI. Drop the component onto your page, and drop an SVG file onto the component. There is an advanced tab for specifying classes and ID.

Demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZez5pW-bZ0

#Known Issues
1. Opening the dialog on Touch UI and attempting to drag an SVG into the path will not work. You must drag direct to the component. This seems to be more of a bug with AEM 6.0's dialog.
